# vacinaki

A new Flutter project.

This project has the academic objective of presenting the proposal to meet the need to search for vaccines. 
Today we have the need to call or go to the place to obtain the information, so this thesis proposes 
the automation of this process, streamlining the information to the citizen and allowing the service to be more 
agile and accurate.
